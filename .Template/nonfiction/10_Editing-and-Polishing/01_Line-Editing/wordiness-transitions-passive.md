Prompts:

Are there overly long or complicated sentences that can be broken up?

Is passive voice used where active would be clearer?

Are transitions between paragraphs and ideas smooth?

Can common filler phrases (e.g., “in order to,” “at the end of the day”) be removed or rewritten?

Is the paragraph structure balanced and readable?
