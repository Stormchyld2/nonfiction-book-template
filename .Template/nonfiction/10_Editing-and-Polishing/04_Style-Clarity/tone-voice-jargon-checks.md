Prompts:

Is the tone consistent with the genre and intended audience?

Are there areas where the voice feels impersonal, forced, or inconsistent?

Are any words or phrases unnecessarily complex or jargon-heavy?

Can certain ideas be expressed more clearly or simply?

Are the author's beliefs or biases presented transparently?
