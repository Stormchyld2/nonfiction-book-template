# ğŸ§± Structure-Flow Editing Tools

These prompts help you test and improve your manuscript's structure and logic after your first draft.

They are **not duplicated here**, but live in the planning phase folder (`01_Structure/`). You should revisit those tools with a new lens during editing.

### ğŸ§° Tools to Reference:

- ğŸ”— [Argument Logic Prompts](../../01_Structure/01_argument-logic-prompts.md)  
  Check your book's reasoning, section transitions, and flow of ideas.

- ğŸ”— [Outline Consistency](../../01_Structure/02_outline-consistency.md)  
  Ensure that your outline still matches what you actually wrote.

ğŸ’¡ *Use this folder as your structure QA pass. Are your ideas building clearly? Does each chapter serve the big idea?*
