<!-- PROMPTS GO HERE -->

Prompts:

Are all claims backed up with reliable data, references, or reasoning?

Is the tone confident and informed without being overbearing?

Are any sources or statistics outdated, vague, or unverifiable?

Does the author maintain consistency in terminology and key concepts?

Does the manuscript project expertise and build trust?
