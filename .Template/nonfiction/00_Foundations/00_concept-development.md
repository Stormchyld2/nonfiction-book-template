# ⚠️ SECTION 7: Common Pitfalls (and How to Avoid Them)

> These mistakes are common across both practical and devotional nonfiction. Use this section to troubleshoot and test your concept.

---

### ❌ Pitfall 1: The “List of Ideas” Book  
**You’re covering too much.**  
✅ Fix: Focus on one powerful transformation, not every lesson you’ve ever learned.

---

### ❌ Pitfall 2: The “What I Want to Say” Trap  
**You’re writing from your voice instead of for the reader’s need.**  
✅ Fix: Rephrase everything through the lens of the reader’s transformation.

---

### ❌ Pitfall 3: You vs. Everyone Book  
**You’re trying to contrast your idea with every other thinker in your field.**  
✅ Fix: Position through clarity, not combat. Define what you are — not just what you aren’t.

---

### ❌ Pitfall 4: The Vague Spiritualism Book  
**You’re using safe or poetic language with no traction.**  
✅ Fix: Name specific outcomes. Give your reader anchors, not abstractions.

---

### ❌ Pitfall 5: The Course Dump  
**You’re writing a repackaged workshop, not a book.**  
✅ Fix: Books require narrative logic and transformation — not just content delivery.

---
