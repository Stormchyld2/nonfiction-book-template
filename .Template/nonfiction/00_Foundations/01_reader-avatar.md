# 👤 SECTION 1: Know Who You’re Writing For

### 1. Who is your **ideal reader**?

Describe them as a specific, real-feeling person — not a demographic category. Give them a name if it helps.

> ✍️ Example (How-To): “Mark is a 34-year-old aspiring writer who’s stuck halfway through 4 different novels.”  
> 🙏 Example (Devotional): “Rebecca is a 41-year-old single mom with a spiritual life shaped by guilt, not grace.”

---

### 2. What does their **daily life** look like?

- What do they do for work or in their home life?
- What pressures or responsibilities do they carry?
- When and where are they most likely to read your book?

---

### 3. What are they **struggling with internally**?

- Doubts, insecurities, limiting beliefs
- Spiritual, emotional, or intellectual unrest
- Where do they feel stuck, afraid, or unworthy?

---

### 4. What are they **trying to do, fix, or find**?

- What actions are they taking (or avoiding)?
- What transformation or result are they chasing?
- What do they *wish* someone would finally tell them?

---

### 5. What kind of **language** do they use?

- What are *their* words for the struggle — not yours?
- What do they say when they vent to a friend?
- How would they describe their problem in a Google search?

✅ **Checklist**
- [ ] I’ve written in their language, not my own  
- [ ] I’ve listened to how they *ask* for help, not just how I *offer* it

---

# 🔍 SECTION 2: Emotional & Spiritual Landscape

### 6. What do they believe (right now) about:
- Themself?
- The problem they face?
- The outcome they want?

> 🙏 Example: “She believes God is disappointed in her because she keeps falling short.”  
> 🧪 Example: “He believes he’s just not a creative person — that story writing is for other people.”

---

### 7. What’s at stake if nothing changes?

- Emotionally: What will hurt more if they stay stuck?
- Spiritually: Will shame, fear, or guilt deepen?
- Practically: Will another year go by with no results?

> Use this to build urgency without manipulation.

---

### 8. What are their **core fears or objections**?

- “I’ve tried before and failed.”
- “This is too complex or theological for me.”
- “Books like this aren’t written for someone like me.”

✅ **Checklist**
- [ ] I know what internal objections my reader will have  
- [ ] I’ve built trust by meeting them where they are

---

# 💡 SECTION 3: Motivation & Desire

### 9. What do they ultimately **want**?

- Do they want to feel differently?
- Accomplish something specific?
- Reclaim a lost identity or role?
- Find peace, purpose, clarity, healing?

---

### 10. What will **success** look like for them?

> Before/After Snapshot:

| Before                      | After                         |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Doubting their purpose      | Feeling called and equipped   |
| Confused by story structure | Confident and writing daily   |
| Spiritually disconnected    | Restored, reflective, grounded|

---

### 11. What kind of **tone, presence, or voice** do they respond to?

- [ ] Encouraging and pastoral  
- [ ] Tough love, no fluff  
- [ ] Deeply empathetic and personal  
- [ ] Tactical and structured  
- [ ] Calm, meditative, sacred  
- [ ] Casual, creative, energized

# ⚠️ SECTION 6: Common Pitfalls

---

### ❌ Pitfall 1: Writing for Everyone  
**You water down the message to be “inclusive.”**  
✅ Fix: Choose someone specific. Write to them. Others will still show up.

---

### ❌ Pitfall 2: Writing for You  
**You’re solving your past self’s problem — not the current reader’s.**  
✅ Fix: Validate your experience, but update it through empathy and current research.

---

### ❌ Pitfall 3: Over-intellectualizing  
**You write to impress peers instead of serve readers.**  
✅ Fix: Prioritize clarity and compassion over cleverness.

---

### ❌ Pitfall 4: Assuming too much  
**You skip steps or use jargon.**  
✅ Fix: Ask yourself, “Would my reader actually know this?” — not “Should they?”

---
