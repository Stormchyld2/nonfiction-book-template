# 📘 SECTION 1: Big-Picture Book Flow

### 1. What is the overall journey or structure?

- Is your book a linear process, cyclical reflection, or open devotional?
- Are you moving through steps, themes, revelations, or principles?

✅ Common nonfiction patterns:
- [ ] Chronological (Start → Finish)
- [ ] Step-by-Step (Method or System)
- [ ] Problem → Solution
- [ ] 30-day or weekly reflection
- [ ] Thematic clusters

---

### 2. What are your **core phases or sections**?

Think of these as the major “movements” or acts in your book.

> ✍️ Example (How-To):  
> 1. Story Fundamentals  
> 2. Building Your Plot  
> 3. Drafting with Confidence

> 🙏 Example (Devotional):  
> 1. Shame  
> 2. Grace  
> 3. Identity  
> 4. Purpose

---

### 3. What does each section *do* for the reader?

For each major phase or part, define its purpose:

- What shift, question, or milestone does it deliver?
- How does it transition from the one before?

✅ **Checklist**
- [ ] Each section has a clear role in the journey  
- [ ] There are no “filler” themes or steps

---

# 🧱 SECTION 2: Chapter Breakdown

### 4. Brainstorm your chapter list (tentative is fine)

Aim for 8–15 total chapters, grouped under your section structure if applicable.

✍️ Use this format:
1. Chapter Title — What it delivers  
2. Chapter Title — What it answers  
3. Chapter Title — What it transforms

✅ Tip: Don't worry about perfect names yet — clarity > cleverness.

---

### 5. What does each chapter **do**?

Use this mini-worksheet for 3 sample chapters to start:

| Chapter Title        | Key Question It Answers   | Reader Shift After This Chapter |
|----------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| The Story Core       | What makes an idea viable? | Reader has a testable idea      |
| Lies We Carry        | What lies shape our shame? | Reader begins inner reflection  |
| Write It Ugly        | How do I start?            | Reader begins writing            |

---

### 6. How does the book **open**?

- What is your hook?
- What emotional or spiritual tension are you establishing in the intro?
- Are you telling a story? Asking a question? Challenging a belief?

✅ Your intro should answer:
- “Why this book?”
- “Why now?”
- “Why you?”

---

### 7. How does the book **close**?

- Do you wrap up with reflection, challenge, final takeaway?
- Do you end with next steps, prayer, journaling, tools, or action?

✅ Tip: The end should echo the beginning and honor the reader’s journey.

---

# 🔄 SECTION 3: Flow, Logic & Reader Momentum

### 8. Does each chapter flow naturally into the next?

- Is there a clear bridge or logical transition?
- Are you walking the reader step by step or letting them explore?
- Does each chapter earn its place?

---

### 9. What recurring tools or anchors will you use?

- [ ] Stories or testimonies  
- [ ] Scripture / Quotes  
- [ ] Action steps or exercises  
- [ ] Reflection questions  
- [ ] Visuals or diagrams  
- [ ] Journal space  
- [ ] Application challenges  
- [ ] Calls to prayer or pause

✅ Use no more than 3–4 anchors consistently. Repetition = reader rhythm.

---

### 10. Where do you risk losing the reader?

Mark weak points in your flow now:

- Is there a saggy middle?
- Are there info-heavy sections with no stories?
- Is there a place where your tone shifts too much?

✅ **Checklist**
- [ ] Pacing is varied but consistent  
- [ ] No chapter feels “extra” or unfocused  
- [ ] The reader is always being moved forward

# ⚠️ SECTION 6: Common Pitfalls

---

### ❌ Pitfall 1: The Flat Outline  
**You have a list, not a journey.**  
✅ Fix: Each chapter should move the reader *forward*, not just sideways.

---

### ❌ Pitfall 2: No Intro Hook  
**Your book starts slow or abstract.**  
✅ Fix: Start with the pain, the story, or the stakes — not a lecture.

---

### ❌ Pitfall 3: The Repetitive Middle  
**Chapters feel interchangeable.**  
✅ Fix: Each chapter must have a distinct goal, tone, or action.

---

### ❌ Pitfall 4: The Theory Dump  
**It reads like a seminar or textbook.**  
✅ Fix: Build in moments of pause, action, or reflection.

---

### ❌ Pitfall 5: The "Me Book"  
**You’re processing out loud instead of guiding.**  
✅ Fix: Make sure every chapter is reader-facing, not self-focused.
