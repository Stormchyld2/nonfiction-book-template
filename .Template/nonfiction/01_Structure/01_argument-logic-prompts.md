<!-- PROMPTS GO HERE -->

Prompts:

Is the logical progression of ideas strong from beginning to end?

Are claims clearly supported by evidence, examples, or citations?

Do transitions connect ideas smoothly and maintain flow?

Are there gaps in reasoning or areas where the argument breaks down?

Are digressions or sidebars used purposefully, or do they distract?
