# 🧠 Nonfiction Book Template System

Welcome to your master nonfiction book template. This system is designed to guide you from initial concept to final manuscript — with every planning, outlining, editing, and publishing stage included.

You’ll use this repo as a **starter project** for each new nonfiction book you create.

2. Rename the project folder with your book's working title.
3. Work through each folder in order — starting with `00_Foundations`.
4. Write your manuscript in the `/manuscript/` folder while referencing your planning files.
5. Use the `10_Editing-and-Polishing/` folder to revise and improve.
6. Add genre-specific tools from `12_Modules/` as needed.
7. Publish, launch, repeat.
